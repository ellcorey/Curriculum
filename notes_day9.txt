####Notes
- Meta tag (one more time)
- PX, PT, EM, Percent 
    + PX - fixed size for screens (1px = one dot on the screen)
        * not consistent over different resolutions
    + PT - fixed size for print
    + EM - scalable size based on the current font size of the document (usually 16px or 1m)
    + pxtoem
    + EXAMPLE: font-size: 1em, 100%, 16px, 12pt -- what happens when you change body {font-size: 100%} vs body {font-size: 120%}
    + Codepen px vs. em (forked)
    + Percent Vs. Em
        * In theory the same, but if you change base font (on body) to 1em instead of default percentage, test what happens font-size: 1em;, font-size: 100%;, body{ font-size: 1em} change **browser** text size smallest vs largest
- Rems
    + em based font sizing compounds (li within an li -- dropdown menu)
        * can only be avoided by declaring child elements as 1em
    + rem stands for "root em"
    + em is relative to the root size of the parent, while rem is relative to the  root (or html) element
    + Cons: not supported very well, must use fallbacks
- Setting up base 10px font size (body: 62.5%)
- Deep Dive into Type: Anatomy of Type
    + cap height - top of capital letters
    + median/x-height
- Line Spacing
    + min line-height of 1.6 for readability
- Kearning
    + awkward spacing for letters that angle out (V, W, T, Y)
    + keep equal perceived space
- Tracking
    + uniform space across a text selection
- Alignment/Body Copy Conventions
- left aligned (no justified text!)
